## Lab 1: Introduction to Java (Functional Programming)

This lab serves as an introduction to Java with a focus on Functional Programming principles. The files associated with this week provide practical examples to familiarize students with basic Java concepts and functional programming paradigms. In this lab, students will:
* Java Basics: Learn fundamental Java concepts with an emphasis on functional programming paradigms.
* Explore Data Structures: Delve into arrays and strings, manipulating them using functional techniques.
* Understand Control Flow & Operators: Dive into loops, type casting, and operators in a functional context.
